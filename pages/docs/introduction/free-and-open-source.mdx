# Free and Open Source
> About the license

The IOPA Specification is provided under a permissive Creative Commons license.  

The IOPA reference implementations, common middleware and sample applications are provided under an APACHE-2 license.

There is no charge to use the IOPA specification in commercial or non-commercial work, and the licenses used were considered carefully to encourage broad use, evolution and adoption in other domains.

In the future the IOPA organization reserves the right to introduce membership fees to cover costs and/or provide consultative services, but is not at that scale yet, and for now is just a volunteer effort by individuals for social benefit.     The specification, implementations, middleware libraries and sample applications will always remain free and open source.

As a community member you must agree to the Contribution License Agreement (CLA) before you can contribute to IOPA open source projects.
