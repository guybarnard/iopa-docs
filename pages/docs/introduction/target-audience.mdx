# Target Audience
> The iopa-io repositories on GitHub

These repositories is primarily geared at application developers and device developers who want to connect their products to the Internet of Things, but don't want to be tied down to any one protocol or standard (be it hardware or software based).  

Further, they want to have a simple "all data flows one way" approach to developing applications or device logic, with a fabric that encourages good programming patterns and discourages anti-patterns.  They don't want to reinvent the wheel and therefore want all boilerplate and common logic for implementing a server to be simple use statements.
